						That was it. A long year of growing, learning, tears, blood, and lots and lots of loving.  Looking back at all of the adventures we've been through, I can tell that this past year was an important growth year. We're no longer in the cutesy honeymoon phase, but now we're maturing.  Needless to say, we still look like middle schoolers lol.  This year has been pretty crazy, right? But thank you for all of the loving you have given me and all of the growth you've led me to. Lol, imagine how we'd be like if we were still singleeee XD. Thank you for the past year, the year before, and to the hearty, healthy, and happy future that will come!
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						The next year is themed <i>You're Stuck With Me</i>, and I can honestly say I'm excited for what will come. We're gonna go through downfalls and tears, but as long as we continue to grow to pick each other up, then nothing can stop #teamsnapback! The next year is gonna be a tough one because we really start defining our own separate futures, and as you said in PCN, <i>"no matter what we go through, no matter where we are, and no matter how old we get (pause) I will always be here for you"</i>. I'll try my very hardest to help you just as much, if not more, than how you've helped me this past year. And no matter what, I'll always be here waiting :)
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						So the way I made this page is (as you can see) from bottom to top. Why? Because we're now as high as ever, and it's not from eating sandwiches lol. You know what's the best part? We're only gonna get higher! Welp, Happy Anniversary boo boo burrr, and cheers to many more years of happiness! I love you lots and lots! I ♥ @(*o*)@ !
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>As you told me 2 years ago, <i>Adventure is out there!</i></p>

					<h1>Dear Kris,</h1>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Here we are in April.  As you know, April is still pretty fresh in our minds.  It's been a long and rough month, but we both have been able to look back at the school year that we've had only to realize how much we've grown individually and as a couple. This past month was definitely a test of many sorts with us, and our relationship.  And we've been passing, so I guess that's a sign? I'm still proud that we make sure to end most nights together and okay with each other.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						When I was watching PCN, I remember seeing your character and realizing that your character was just you in the next 80 years.  And I can't wait until the next 80 years together with all these derpy moments.  At picnic, we won 2 years in a row for cutest couple! I was honestly not expecting that, but it was honorable lol. PEOPLE THINK WE'RE CUTE.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Remember 2 years ago with Karen's dog, Titus? Lol. I was like "no" to you, and you were blownnn.  But, now look at us :D.  I love where we've been, and I'm excited for where we're heading!

						VACATIONNN. We took a vacation together! And with friends of course, but it was fun together! Of course, we got to learn more about our housemates, and I hope that this little 'retreat' helped you out!  The whole ride was fantastic. Even from the car ride, to eating at my fam's house, actually being in Orlando! Looking back at it all, it felt like a dream just because of how much fun we had. I sincerely hope that you really did enjoy that trip, and I'm looking forward to taking more trips like that! 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						This summer, remember that we need to have a pool party at your place! I wanna swim with ducky lol. And after, we'll go to Six Flags and ride Kingda-Ka and the drop tower ride that's attached (JK I won't force you lol). Promise we'll have fun in the pool and in more amusement parks! 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						In the future, let's get to Brazil, Hawaii, Philippines, the Bahamas, and of course North Korea. That's a promise lol.  But forreals, I wanna make more vids and pics of our vacation adventures, so we can look back and remember how much fun the ride was! The sandwich night was so fun with everyone, and I hope we eat sandwiches together yet again lol.

					Whoo lots of pics for this month lol. We partied lots, and enjoyed each other's company lots.  We got our monthly pho fill, and we ate sandwiches before Nathan's party and lost gravity, went to Fred's and enjoyed his crying, went to DC for Valentine's day, enjoyed Andrew's birthday with the appearance of King Krabby, and built a snowman. Wow, there was so much that happened this month lol. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					DC for Valentine's day was so nice of you to plan! THAT FRENCH ONION SOUP lol. The crêpes were just so damn good lol. When we got back to the house, we just enjoyed each other's company while Carl ATE IT, well according to Troy lol.  We had so much fun on those weekends, and during the week we had so much snow. The first snowman was so cute, and I can't wait to build more! I wanna make a Kres snowman, and by Kres I mean a koala lolol. Thanks for the adventures, and I'm looking forward to many more!

					We kicked off 2014 with a nice Gingerbread house lol.  Or a monster house lol.  I remember your mom and brother were both like "Oh, yeah....it looks like a house...." LOL. We failed so hard, but it was so fun. I should've just bought graham crackers instead of trying to bake them lolol.  No matter how bad it looked, I am still proud of it. Let's do this more in the future, but make it look legit lol. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					After, I got to see high kres straight from the wisdom tooth extraction lol. Your bloody laway got on the couch, me, and pillows lololol.  I felt so bad that you were barely able to eat the soup, and I was enjoying some nice chickun lolol. Luckily you healed fairly quickly and you were able to eat quickly soon after!
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>	
					We took another NYC trip! I think this is the last one we've had? Well, you got to sleep over and hang out with me, Troy, Oz, and Carl lol. Just Patty and the guys, and we met up with Dana. Remember how full we were after Chicken and Rice? That day was fun! And we got to cuddle lol. We got sushi palace....yeah that was rough, but we got full! Looking back at all of these fights, I can't even remember why we were fighting to begin with lol. I can't tell if that's a good thing or bad thing, but I guess it's good that I really remember the good over the bad! Welp, until next month!

					Merry Kwis-mas! Lol, you're so cute about that thing.  Well, semi happened and you saved the day when Hulk Patty came out! I think it's funny now about how you drove in DC lol. I AM SO SORRY BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. I mean, there have been better semis, but you still looked as spiffy as ever, even if you couldn't smile or anything lol.  That's one of the worst my temper has ever reached, so there can't be that much worse, right? lol

				<p>
					I saw the Salvadors and Paduas again for Christmas eve! Just chilling at your fam's house was so comfortable, and just talking with your cuzzos. I wish I could have stayed longer, but there's always more time for that.  Remember when your dad made us take a picture together? lol. He was so happy with it, and the whole Christmas town set next to us was so much lol. If I may, I wanna visit your fam for fam parties more, is that okay? lol. And of course I'd like you to meet mine if you're available to when they come. That's all for now!

					My birthday month! It's still weird to me that we're only exactly one week apart lol.  You guys threw me a little surprise party with my family, and it was so nice lol.  After Turkeybowl practice, it def was a fun surprise to have, and thank you for leading it with my family.  We also visited the pandas at the zoo! Remember seeing the pandas chilling straight up? They were living the life eating their caramel apples lol.  That was such a fun date! We walked around A LOT, got some Pho, and just relaxed.  We deserve more happy days like that lol.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					In the middle of the month, you became my number one cheerleader and cheered me on through Turkeybowl.  #1 cheerleader :D.  That's what I love about you. You cheer me on even when it's cold and you could be doing something else.  Through this relationship, you continuously pushed to make me better and to do better for myself.  You praise me when I don't recognize my own accomplishments.  I know I'm not there yet, but I'll be that cheerleader for you soon!

					October was a rough month, remember? Or, you don't wanna lol. But yeah, first off I want to thank you for your tenacity to help me get better. October was a high point for my comparison talk, but ya know, that brought us closer of course. Remember we went to the mall after taking a trip to Ten Ren's, and we just talked? You calmed me down, and although this wasn't the end of the problem, it was a big comfort to me to see how much you cared about me.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Remember your birthday? WE SURPRISED YOU SO WELL. Did you really have no idea that it was happening? Lol it was fun! I remember you telling me that you just wanted to relax, and didn't wanna party or anything, but we forced one on you anyway lol. You opened the door and you were automatically greeted with alcohol and friends lol. That was so much fun to plan out, and also to make the banner for XD.  Hopefully the future will also be filled with more wonderful surprises! Looking back, I had a lot of fun with the party itself, and everyone had fun dressing up (remember Min as the ugly minion lol). I hope that your 20th birthday was definitely memorable :)
				</p> 
				<br/>
				<p>
					This was also the month where we took our legit CPORK fam pics. We were all matching in our stripes and even the colors worked out! In the future, you know we gonna have stupid, cheezy matchign days, so be prepped!

				<p>
					September was when we both really moved into CPORK and started living together. First off, that shouldn't even have happened, but we're just so lucky somehow.  During our first year, we were used to seeing each other everyday, but living together was a whole new learning process. I can personally say that I care more about being neat and tidy because of you. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Ya know, living together now only makes me curious about what it would be like really living with each other, just us two.  If we get to that point, maybe it'll be a smoother transition, ya know? It's incredibly scary to think about what the future will hold for us, but I'm also incredibly excited for the possibilities (the good ones of course lol).  When I was younger, I never imagined a future really thinking about being with someone; I primarily thought about exploring the world, going skydiving, snowboarding in Aspen, and others. When I imagined that future, I was alone. But now,, I can't imagine doing any of those things without someone, like you! GET READY TO GO SNOWBOARDING IN ASPEN AND SKYDIVING :D

					This month, we had just finished working, so we took more trips to NYC! Christian, Charlon, and Carrington (CCC lol) came up, and we got to sorta be their tour guides with Oz! We took that other separate trip to run to the Brooklyn bridge (and saw Sheena along the way lol). And of course, I came over your house a lot and we got to look through baby pictures saw pics of bebe kres :3 lol.  
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Hey, no matter where we go and no matter what cities we visit, remember that NYC is our city. DC and Boston can be runner ups lol. You wanna know why NYC is ours? Because it just is lol. Whenver we visit, it still feels like a new experience to be there with you.  When we go to South Street Seaport and just enjoy the view, it's like a whole new feeling each time.  I love it when we just sit there and talk until we realize that it's late. We just get so lost looking up and looking at each other. I guess in DC, we just haven't found <i>that spot</i> like in NYC. That's why New York is ours, and always will be.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					By August this summer, you'll be back (hopefully)!  I know at least one or two NYC trips are gonna happen lol. Part of me just wants to skip over June and July so that I can come right back to us again, but I'll wait. Good things come to those who wait, right? Lol.

					July was a more hang out after work type of month lol. Remember that time when there was an intern volunteer day, but we decided to go and get sushi and hang out at my place? And remember when we went to get sushi, we couldn't finish everything but were too cheap to pay the fee, so you put the sushi in your pocket and threw it away in the restroom? Lol we just way too much fun together. We also had our many lunch dates and had given up on talking to other interns really (cept Christopher Chestnut lol).  We visited New York again, but this time with the other interns, and it was fun! Rode the bus together and hung at your place for a bit :D 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Not gonna lie, this summer is gonna be tough.  We've been so blessed to be able to be with each other consistently, and we even live close by in Joisey, so this summer will definitely be a gap. I know how my personality is and the whole comparison thing, but please continue to be patient with me. This summer should be fun! You'll be in a new city with J10 and Mariel, and there's so much to explore! Maybe I'll visitttt, lol. I still expect video movie dates every now and then! Bring me back souvenirs :D

Gchat was our best friend lol.  Our little cubicle dates were a nice break from our work, and it was always worth the distance.

				<p>
					Believe it or not, I actually REALLY ENJOYED going to NYC with you for Digitour -_-. We got Chicken and Rice, and we got some comfy seats away from the children.  Kina Grannis and Clara C were on point! And then we took a nice walk through many different avenues and streets to get to Maharlika, where we lucky to get seating. Remember the chicharon? Gahhh too good lol.

We've pushed each other to our breaking points, but we've always come back together after realizing how much we really do love being with each other.
