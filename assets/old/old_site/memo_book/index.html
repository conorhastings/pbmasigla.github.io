				<div class="box w-25 h-100">
					<div class="img-cont img-1 img-1-expanded"></div>
					<h3>Who Am I?<span>A Short Bio</span></h3>
					<p>I was born in the Philippines in 1993, and spent the first 3 years of my childhood in my homeland.   My parents moved the family to America in 1996 when they landed jobs as Information Technology professionals.   I was exposed early on  the various tasks and functions that my parents performed at their respective jobs, and that heavily influenced my decision and interest in the area of Information Technology.  I took my first programming class using Visual Basic during my sophomore year of high school, and it was such an affirming and rewarding experience when I developed my first GUI screen and saw it perform its intended function right before my eyes.  It felt like building my first robot; bringing life to an inanimate object.  I pursued additional programming classes in the following years.  I was introduced to Java in my junior year,  and then HTML, CSS, and PHP in my senior year.  I knew then that when I leave high school,  I would like to focus and venture towards acquiring an education, knowledge and honing my skills that would prepare me for a career in Information Technology.</p>
					<br>
					<p>At the present time, while most of my skills and experience are focused towards web development, I have also dabbled in application development and engineering.  I aim to continuously learn and implement applications in new programming languages,  and keep myself up to date with new technologies and development platforms.  From Java to Node.js to jQuery, I am interested in learning them all.   </p>
					<br>
					<p>Lastly, I am also interested in focusing on the information systems field, learning about various facets of the Software Development Life Cycle, and  building applications for business processes and business functions.  It is my ultimate goal to obtain experience and exposure on various roles within SDLC not only in programming, debugging and defect resolution,  but also in areas of Quality Assurance,  Systems Analysis, Data Analysis... the possibilities are endless!    </p>

					<h3>Welcome!</h3>
					<p>My name is Patricia Masigla, and I am currently a junior at the University of Maryland, College Park.  I am working hard to become an Information Systems analyst, and I also enjoy doing web development.  I created this website to provide a glimpse of my my life and work experience,  and also to showcase my actual web development skills.  Thank you for passing through, and I hope you have a positive experience here.  </p>
				</div>
				<div class="box w-25 h-100">
					<div class="img-cont img-3"></div>
					<h3>My Interests</h3>
					<p>Aside from my passion in web and application development, and building my technical skills,  I am also an avid sports enthusiast.
					Since I was a child, I have always been active in sports. I started playing basketball when I was in kindergarden, and have been playing ever since.  I started playing tennis in middle school and continued throughout high school, and now I just play for leisure. Ever since I was 12, I have been spending my winter weekends up the mountains with my snowboarding gliding down the slopes. Currently, I am the running back for my organization's women's flag football team, the Lady Terps.  </p>   
					<br>
					<p>A recent hobby that I have picked up is photography and video production.  I like carrying my camera around ready to take pictures of anything.  I like exploring new cameras and new features that are created, and I also enjoying the different ways and features pictures can be taken with(like HDR, manipulating aperture and shutter speed ISO).  Filming, directing, and editing videos are new hobbies that I'm exploring more and more of. To me, it really is amusing putting together bits and pieces of video and pictures to create bigger end products.</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					Whether in web development or sports, I give my best to accomplish my job and the tasks at hand.  I am an effective team player who works well with everyone from my team whether to deliver a code, collaborate on a project, provide defense, steal that basketball, or grab the football to complete a touchdown.  I am also focused and motivated to achieve either my personal goal, or the team's overall goal.  I have proven my ability to wear many hats, and set the right priorities.  I am driven, results-oriented and I face challenges head-on --- whether in the field of technology or the various sports that I participate in.    </p>

I built one of the newest blogs <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/">The Experts</a>,  which was rolled out this past summer, using PHP and the Wordpress platform.

In addition to those blogs, I also coded/developed PHP functions that allowed for a smoother process of sending stories to the Wall Street Journal's main downstream feed for the blogs and main Online Wall Street Journal sections.  Development was performed on a real-life agile environment with multiple sprint releases and deployments in collaboration with various experts in the fields.
