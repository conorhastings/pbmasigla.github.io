The aim of the project is to create an epistemic game to teach players how to think more like a creative professional in design. As noted by epistemicgames.org:

*"Creative professionals learn innovative thinking through training that is very different from traditional academic classrooms because innovative thinking means more than just knowing the right answers on a test. It also means having real-world skills, high standards and professional values, and a particular way of thinking about problems and justifying solutions."*

Kaiopua is a science fiction builder / puzzle game, that has the player adopt the identity of a Pacific Islander, lost at sea, who finds a home aboard the most unexpected of creatures by learning the ways of taro farming. The game will be accessible and playable via website, and will not require any third party plug-ins or software beyond the web browser of player's choice.

####Core Goal
The core goal of the project is to create a universal design education tool that may teach players to better understand grid, spacing, order, modularity, and efficiency within design. Primarily target audiences are teenage students, roughly ages 10 - 14, and college level undergraduate students, ages 18 - 25, of all genders.
