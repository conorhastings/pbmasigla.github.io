List of Games that may have influenced the project  
1. alphabetical game name (with genre)  
2. one sentence description  
3. why I played  
4. what we may learn from the game (intentional or not)  
  
##Summary
I tend to play games more for the aspect of interaction with others through gaming, with a preference for playing with friends as opposed to alone. Unique core mechanics, i.e. something I haven't experienced before, is the other major reason I seem to play games, as I am always seeking out new challenges. Exploration is another driving force for why I play any game, though it is not as common as the others and is most prominent in games with non-linear gameplay.
